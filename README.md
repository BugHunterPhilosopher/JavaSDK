The OpenGamma service is a platform for the independent calculation of metrics such as margin, fees and balance sheet, to enable firms to optimise execution and clearing of derivatives. The service is available commercially from [OpenGamma](http://www.opengamma.com/).

This repository contains the source code of the client library of the service.
It is released as Open Source Software under the [Apache v2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). 
The client library is only provided in Java, however the service itself can be called from any language.
